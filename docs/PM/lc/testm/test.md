# LASER CUTTING
Laser cutting is a precise and versatile manufacturing process that utilizes a focused beam of light to cut or engrave materials. The term "LASER" stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. The technology behind laser cutting involves the use of a laser, typically a CO2 or fiber laser, to generate a high-intensity beam of light.

Here is an introduction to the key aspects of laser cutting:

**How it Works** <br>
Generation of Laser Beam: A laser cutting machine produces a concentrated beam of light by exciting a gain medium, such as a gas or crystal, through a process called stimulated emission. This produces coherent light, meaning all the photons have the same frequency and phase.

Focusing the Beam: The laser beam is then directed through a series of mirrors and lenses to focus it into a tight, high-energy spot.

Material Interaction: When the focused laser beam makes contact with a material, it rapidly heats and vaporizes or melts the material at the point of interaction.

Computer-Controlled Cutting Path: The cutting process is controlled by a computer numerical control (CNC) system, which directs the laser beam along a precise cutting path determined by a digital design or program.


**Materials** <br>
Laser cutting is capable of working with a wide range of materials, including but not limited to:

Metals: Stainless steel, aluminum, copper, etc.
Plastics: Acrylic, polycarbonate, ABS, etc.
Wood: Plywood, MDF, hardwoods, etc.
Textiles: Fabric, leather, felt, etc. <br>
**Applications**
Industrial Cutting: Used in manufacturing industries for precise cutting of metal sheets, pipes, and other components.
Prototyping: Rapid prototyping and small-scale production for product development.
Engraving and Marking: Creating detailed designs or adding identification marks on various materials.
Art and Decor: Crafting intricate designs in artistic or decorative pieces. <br>

## SAFETY INSTRUCTION

Safety instructions are crucial guidelines designed to protect individuals from potential hazards and ensure a secure environment in various settings, including workplaces, laboratories, construction sites, and public spaces. The primary goal of safety instructions is to prevent accidents, injuries, and other adverse events by promoting awareness, proper practices, and adherence to established safety protocols.
<br>
**Laser Hazard Classification**
<br>
LASER cutters are typically classified by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as Class 1 LASERs, emitting low-energy levels that pose no hazard to the eyes or skin. However, these devices often contain enclosed Class 3B or 4 LASERs, capable of emitting high-energy levels and posing risks. Only manufacturer-trained personnel should conduct maintenance.
<br>

**Safety Guidelines**
<br>

No Modifications: Do not modify or disable safety features of the laser system.
Cover and Interlock: Operate the laser only if all covers are in place, and interlocks are functioning properly.
Avoid Direct Gaze: Never look directly into the LASER beam to prevent eye hazards.
<br>

**Laser Generated Air Contaminants**
<br>

Laser Generated Air Contaminants (LGAC) refer to airborne particles and gases produced during laser processes, such as cutting, engraving, or welding. These contaminants can include fine particulate matter, vapors, and fumes that may pose health risks to individuals in the vicinity. Proper ventilation and safety measures are essential to mitigate exposure and maintain a safe working environment when using lasers.

**Filtration and Ventilation Requirements**

**Filtration Requirements:**
Filtration refers to the process of removing impurities or particles from air, liquids, or gases. In various industries and environments, filtration systems are employed to ensure that contaminants, such as dust, pollutants, or airborne particles, are effectively captured and prevented from entering sensitive areas. Filtration requirements are essential for maintaining clean and safe environments, especially in settings where air quality is critical, such as clean rooms, laboratories, and industrial facilities.
<br>

**Ventilation Requirements:**
Ventilation involves the movement of air to maintain a fresh and healthy atmosphere within a confined space. Ventilation requirements are established to ensure adequate air exchange, control temperature, remove pollutants, and provide sufficient oxygen levels. Proper ventilation is crucial in buildings, workplaces, and enclosed areas to prevent the accumulation of harmful gases, odors, or airborne contaminants. It also contributes to the overall well-being and comfort of occupants by regulating indoor air quality and promoting a safe and conducive environment.
<br>

**Laser safety**
<br>
Laser safety involves the implementation of measures and protocols to minimize the risks associated with the use of lasers. It encompasses guidelines to protect individuals from potential harm to their eyes and skin due to exposure to laser radiation. Laser safety measures include proper classification and labeling of lasers, using appropriate protective equipment, establishing controlled access areas, and providing training to personnel. Adhering to laser safety practices ensures a secure working environment and reduces the risk of injuries related to laser use.

**Laser classes**
<br>
Laser classes categorize lasers based on their potential to cause harm, as defined by international standards such as those by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). There are four main classes:
Class 1: Safe under normal operating conditions; poses no hazard to the eyes or skin.
Class 2: Low-power visible lasers, generally safe due to the blink reflex; limited risk.
Class 3: Medium-power lasers, subdivided into 3R (low risk) and 3B (caution required).
Class 4: High-power lasers with the highest risk; capable of causing severe injury.

## MATERIALS

1. Paper
2. Acrylic
3. Wood


## MACHINE PREPARATION

Make sure to check all connections, this includes the power socket for the laser cutter, the smoke exhaust fan which should be open and running, the water tank, and the pump.

## RUNNING THE MACHINE

Turn on the laser cutter. place the material flat on the platform. place a block between the nozzle and material. rise platform to min the gap.

**Power and Speed Demo**

<br><img src="PM\lc\testm\d_demo.png" style="float: center;" >
We've developed a demonstration featuring seven cut pieces with varying power settings: 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40,  30,20 and 10. And the speed settings: 10mm/s,20mm/s,30mm/s,40mm/s,60mm/s. These squares were designed in AutoCad, and their specifications were imported into LaserCAD using a DXF file. This demo allows us to assess and determine the optimal parameters for the cutting process.
