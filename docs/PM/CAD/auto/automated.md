# AUTOMATED MODELLING

Automated modeling is a new feature that takes elements from the ‘loft’ design tool and the AI-based Generative Design feature to join multiple features and produce numerous design options that a user may have never imagined. Unlike the loft tool, Automated Modelling can create a transitional shape between multiple solid bodies, not just between faces. This means far more complex and innovative bodies can be created, which previously would have taken a user a lot of time and multiple operations to complete.

Automated Modelling can also bridge the gap between the standard Fusion 360 design workspace and the Generative Design Extension. This tool allows a user to generate AI powered designs by selecting which bodies to join and which to avoid. 
## STEPS
Create a temporarly  cubes in the fusion 3D by sketching them 
Create a sketch
<br>

<br>
Create four  temporary cubes
<br>

<br>
Select one side of the cube and Click M to move the cubes to the desired position
<br>

<br>

Select all cubes created and press E for exclude and set the desired parameters

<br>

Click on Automated Modeling.

<br>
Select one  faces of the cube to connect(3faces from 3 different cubes are selected).  You can also  select areas Where you dont want to create new geometry

<br>
Select a body you want to avoid to create a new geometry (1 body in red is the one to be avoided )
<br>

<br>
select new components in operation and click generate
<br>

<br>
Wait for some minute for the alternative model to be  construction  and select the model you like
