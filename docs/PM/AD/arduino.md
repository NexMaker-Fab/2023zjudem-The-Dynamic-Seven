**What is TinkerCad Circuit?**

**Tinkercad Circuits** 
Tinkercad Circuits is an innovative online platform that simplifies the process of learning and teaching electronics. It provides students and enthusiasts with a user-friendly, interactive circuit editor and a wide range of simulated electronic components. With Tinkercad Circuits, users can explore, connect, and experiment with virtual electronic designs, making it an ideal resource for anyone looking to grasp the fundamentals of electronics and circuitry. Whether you're a student or an electronics enthusiast, Tinkercad Circuits offers a powerful toolset for hands-on learning and experimentation, all accessible through any computer with an internet connection. Discover the world of electronics with ease and creativity!"

1. Exploring Circuits

We may view our most recent designs on a dashboard after logging into Tinkercad. The Circuits part is located under Designs.By clicking Designs on the left, we may locate Circuits. Next, press the Highlight buttons.

While on the dashboard, we can scroll through our existing 3D, Codeblocks or Circuits designs. By picking the editor we want to use and pressing the blue + New icon in the dashboard's top right corner, we can easily create a new design.

The Circuits editor in Tinkercad is organised similarly to its 3D design editor. You'll discover a sizable window for designing our layout on the left. A panel containing parts we can drag and drop onto the workspace to build our circuit is visible on the right side.

Unlike Tinkercad’s 3D design editor, the workspace in Circuits is two-dimensional. We can move our components around by selecting and dragging them, or pan the view around our design by clicking and dragging the empty space around it.

We can also zoom in and out of our design by using the scroll wheel on our mouse, a two-finger gesture on our trackpad, or a key combination of Command + and Command -. 

A “Zoom to fit” button is located in the top left corner of the workspace, which will center and zoom your design to fill the window. Pressing the letter F on your keyboard works as a handy shortcut for this same command.

In this video, we try to show how to access more components, use the drop-down menu to select the All Components view, or search for specific components using the search bar beneath the menu.

2. Learning Basic Circuits
Tinkercad is more than just a platform for exploring electronics. We include a selection of interactive lessons that students can use to learn electronics at their own pace. 

The hub for all Tinkercad Circuits instructional content can be found on our [ Tinker > Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)
 page, accessible from the top navigation bar of our design dashboard.

Scrolling down on the Circuits page allows we can  dive into lessons with varying degrees of difficulty.

3. Arduino in Tinkercad
For over 15 years, the Arduino ecosystem of microcontroller boards and code libraries have become an indispensable part of electronics education. 

The Arduino simulation within Tinkercad simplifies the learning experience. It’s free, works on any computer with an Internet connection, and scales to any class size. Best of all, Tinkercad Circuits provides a bottomless supply of virtual components that students can use to build and simulate their projects.

When they’re ready to physically prototype their projects, Tinkercad Circuits makes it easy to export their code as a native Arduino (.ino) file that they can upload to their board.

4. Arduino Starters
One of the fastest ways to explore the possibilities of Arduino in Tinkercad is to simply drag one of our sample Starter circuits into our workspace.

 Arduino Starter circuits to choose from. In this  example which is includes simple code that we can view, simulate, and modify. And in below there are some pictures that describe everystep.

 Its a simple Led blinker using Arduino . Last week we do it in the class.

 Here I mark the point Red and Green Led is off and Simulation is also off.   <br>

 Here I mark the point Green Led is on Because  Simulation is ON.  <br>
