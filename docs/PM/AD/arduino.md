<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/Sketch.jpg">
<BR>

**File**

- New: Creates a new blank editor window with the basic structure of a sketch already set up.

- Open: Allows you to load a sketch file by browsing your computer's drives and folders.

- Open Recent: Provides a short list of the most recently opened sketches for easy access.

- ketchbook: Displays the sketches within the sketchbook folder structure, and clicking on a sketch opens it in a new editor window.

- Examples: Lists all the examples provided by the Arduino Software, organized by topic or library, making them easily accessible.

- Close: Closes the current instance of the Arduino Software (IDE) that you're working in.

- Save: Saves the current sketch with its existing name. If the file hasn't been named previously, you'll be prompted to provide a name in a "Save as..." window. Save as...: Lets you save the current sketch with a different name or in a different location.

- Page Setup: Opens the Page Setup window for configuring print settings.

- Print: Sends the current sketch to the printer based on the settings defined in Page Setup.

- Preferences: Opens the Preferences window where you can customize certain settings of the IDE, including the language of the IDE interface.

- Quit: Closes all open IDE windows. Any sketches that were open when you chose to quit will be automatically reopened the next time you start the IDE.

**Edit**

- Undo/Redo: Allows you to step back or forward through your recent editing actions.

- Cut: Removes the selected text from the editor and stores it in the clipboard for later use.

- Copy: Duplicates the selected text and places it in the clipboard.

- Copy for Forum: Copies your sketch's code to the clipboard in a format suitable for posting in a forum, complete with syntax coloring.

- Copy as HTML: Copies your sketch's code to the clipboard in HTML format, making it suitable for embedding in web pages.

- Paste: Inserts the contents of the clipboard at the current cursor position in the editor.

- Select All: Highlights and selects the entire content of the editor.

- Comment/Uncomment: Adds or removes the "//" comment marker at the start of each selected line, making it easy to comment or uncomment code.

- Increase/Decrease Indent: Adds or removes a space at the beginning of each selected line, adjusting the text's indentation.

- Find: Opens the Find and Replace window, enabling you to search for specific text within your current sketch with various search options.

- Find Next: Highlights the next occurrence of the specified search string in the Find window, relative to the cursor's position.

- Find Previous: Highlights the previous occurrence of the specified search string in the Find window, relative to the cursor's position.

**Sketch**

- Verify/Compile: Checks your sketch for errors by compiling it and provides information on memory usage for code and variables in the console area.

- Upload: Compiles your sketch and uploads the resulting binary file to the configured Arduino board through the specified port.

- Upload Using Programmer: This option overwrites the bootloader on the board. To restore it and enable USB serial port uploads, you'll need to use "Tools > Burn Bootloader." However, this allows you to utilize the full capacity of the Flash memory for your sketch. Note that this command does not change the fuse settings, which can be adjusted via "Tools > Burn Bootloader."

- Export Compiled Binary: Saves a .hex file, which can be archived or uploaded to the board using other tools.

- Show Sketch Folder: Opens the folder where your current sketch is located.

- Include Library: Allows you to add a library to your sketch by inserting #include statements at the beginning of your code. You can also access the Library Manager from this menu to import new libraries from .zip files.

- Add File...: This option lets you include additional files in your sketch. These files are copied from their current location and stored in the data subfolder of the sketch. This subfolder is intended for assets like documentation and is not compiled as part of the sketch program.

 **Tools**
  
- Auto Format: This feature automatically formats your code, ensuring that curly braces line up correctly and statements within braces are indented properly for improved code readability.

- Archive Sketch: Creates a backup copy of the current sketch in .zip format, storing it in the same directory as the original sketch.

- Fix Encoding & Reload: Resolves potential character encoding discrepancies between the editor and the operating system, ensuring consistent character mapping.

- Serial Monitor: Opens the serial monitor window, allowing data exchange with any connected board on the selected Port. This operation often triggers a reset on the board (if supported) when the serial port is opened.

- Board: Select the specific board you're using from a list. This choice is crucial for configuring the IDE to work with the correct board.

- Port: Lists all the available serial devices (real or virtual) on your computer. The list automatically refreshes each time you open the top-level tools menu.

- Programmer: This option is for selecting a hardware programmer when programming a board or microcontroller that isn't using the onboard USB-serial connection. Typically, this isn't needed for regular use but may be used when burning a bootloader to a new microcontroller.

- Burn Bootloader: This menu allows you to burn a bootloader onto the microcontroller of an Arduino board. It's not necessary for the standard operation of an Arduino board but can be useful if you're working with a new ATmega microcontroller that doesn't have a bootloader. Ensure that you've chosen the correct board from the "Boards" menu before burning the bootloader on the target board. This command also sets the appropriate fuse settings.

**Help**

- Help and Documentation: In the Arduino IDE, you can conveniently access various documents that come with the software, such as "Getting Started," "Reference," and this guide. These documents are accessible locally without requiring an internet connection. They mirror the online versions and might contain links back to the official website.

- Find in Reference: The "Find in Reference" function within the Help menu is interactive. It directly opens the relevant page in the local Reference documentation for the function or command currently under your cursor.

- Sketchbook: The Arduino IDE employs the concept of a "sketchbook," which serves as a standardized location for storing your programs, often referred to as sketches. You can access sketches from the "File > Sketchbook" menu or the "Open" button on the toolbar. When you first use the Arduino software, it automatically creates a directory for your sketchbook. You can modify the sketchbook's location through the Preferences dialog if needed.

- File Extensions: Starting with version 1.0, sketches are saved with a .ino file extension, while previous versions used the .pde extension. You can still open .pde files in version 1.0 and later, and the software will automatically rename the extension to .ino.

- Tabs, Multiple Files, and Compilation: The Arduino IDE supports the management of sketches with multiple files, each of which appears in its own tab. These files can be standard Arduino code files (with no visible extension), C files (.c extension), C++ files (.cpp), or header files (.h).

**Uploading**

- Preparing for Sketch Upload: Before you upload your sketch to an Arduino board, you must make the correct selections from the "Tools > Board" and "Tools > Port" menus in the Arduino IDE. The specific boards are described below. On a Mac, you will likely find the serial port listed as something like /dev/tty.usbmodem241 (for boards like UNO, Mega2560, or Leonardo) or /dev/tty.usbserial-1B1 (for older USB boards like Duemilanove) or /dev/tty.USA19QW1b1P1.1 (for serial boards connected with a Keyspan USB-to-Serial adapter). On Windows, it might be COM1 or COM2 for serial boards or higher COM numbers like COM4, COM5, COM7 for USB boards. You can check the ports section of the Windows Device Manager for USB serial devices. On Linux, it should be something like /dev/ttyACMx or /dev/ttyUSBx. Once you've chosen the correct serial port and board, you can initiate the sketch upload by clicking the upload button in the toolbar or selecting "Upload" from the "Sketch" menu. With modern Arduino boards, the reset process is automatic, and the upload begins. However, with older boards that lack auto-reset (pre-Diecimila), you need to press the reset button on the board just before starting the upload. Most boards will show the RX and TX LEDs blinking as the sketch is uploaded. The Arduino IDE will provide a message when the upload is complete or display an error if something goes wrong.

- Using the Arduino Bootloader: When you upload a sketch, you are utilizing the Arduino bootloader, a small program already loaded onto the microcontroller of your board. This bootloader allows you to upload code without requiring additional hardware. The bootloader is active for a brief moment when the board resets, after which it loads the most recently uploaded sketch onto the microcontroller. You'll notice the on-board LED (usually connected to pin 13) blinking when the bootloader starts, such as when the board resets

**Libraries**

- Libraries provide extra functionality for use in sketches, e.g. working with hardware or manipulating data. To use a library in a sketch, select it from the Sketch > Import Library menu. This will insert one or more #include statements at the top of the sketch and compile the library with your sketch. Because libraries are uploaded to the board with your sketch, they increase the amount of space it takes up. If a sketch no longer needs a library, simply delete its #include statements from the top of your code.

- There is a list of libraries in the reference. Some libraries are included with the Arduino software. Others can be downloaded from a variety of sources or through the Library Manager. Starting with version 1.0.5 of the IDE, you do can import a library from a zip file and use it in an open sketch. See these instructions for installing a third-party library.

1. Exploring Circuits

We may view our most recent designs on a dashboard after logging into Tinkercad. The Circuits part is located under Designs.By clicking Designs on the left, we may locate Circuits. Next, press the Highlight buttons. 

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/second.png">

While on the dashboard, we can scroll through our existing 3D, Codeblocks or Circuits designs. By picking the editor we want to use and pressing the blue + New icon in the dashboard's top right corner, we can easily create a new design.

The Circuits editor in Tinkercad is organised similarly to its 3D design editor. You'll discover a sizable window for designing our layout on the left. A panel containing parts we can drag and drop onto the workspace to build our circuit is visible on the right side. 
<br>

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/3rd.png">
<br>

Unlike Tinkercad’s 3D design editor, the workspace in Circuits is two-dimensional. We can move our components around by selecting and dragging them, or pan the view around our design by clicking and dragging the empty space around it.

We can also zoom in and out of our design by using the scroll wheel on our mouse, a two-finger gesture on our trackpad, or a key combination of Command + and Command -. 

A “Zoom to fit” button is located in the top left corner of the workspace, which will center and zoom your design to fill the window. Pressing the letter F on your keyboard works as a handy shortcut for this same command.
