- Verify/Compile: Checks your sketch for errors by compiling it and provides information on memory usage for code and variables in the console area.

- Upload: Compile your sketch and upload the resulting binary file to the configured Arduino board through the specified port.

- Upload Using Programmer: This option overwrites the bootloader on the board. To restore it and enable USB serial port uploads, you'll need to use "Tools > Burn Bootloader." However, this allows you to utilize the full capacity of the Flash memory for your sketch. Note that this command does not change the fuse settings, which can be adjusted via "Tools > Burn Bootloader."

- Export Compiled Binary: Saves a .hex file, which can be archived or uploaded to the board using other tools.

- Show Sketch Folder: Opens the folder where your current sketch is located.

- Include Library: Allows you to add a library to your sketch by inserting #include statements at the beginning of your code. You can also access the Library Manager from this menu to import new libraries from .zip files.

- Add File...: This option lets you include additional files in your sketch. These files are copied from their current location and stored in the data subfolder of the sketch. This subfolder is intended for assets like documentation and is not compiled as part of the sketch program.

 **Tools**
  
- Auto Format: This feature automatically formats your code, ensuring that curly braces line up correctly and statements within braces are indented properly for improved code readability.

- Archive Sketch: Creates a backup copy of the current sketch in .zip format, storing it in the same directory as the original sketch.

- Fix Encoding & Reload: Resolves potential character encoding discrepancies between the editor and the operating system, ensuring consistent character mapping.

- Serial Monitor: Opens the serial monitor window, allowing data exchange with any connected board on the selected Port. This operation often triggers a reset on the board (if supported) when the serial port is opened.

- Board: Select the specific board you're using from a list. This choice is crucial for configuring the IDE to work with the correct board.

- Port: Lists all the available serial devices (real or virtual) on your computer. The list automatically refreshes each time you open the top-level tools menu.

- Programmer: This option is for selecting a hardware programmer when programming a board or microcontroller that isn't using the onboard USB-serial connection. Typically, this isn't needed for regular use but may be used when burning a bootloader to a new microcontroller.

- Burn Bootloader: This menu allows you to burn a bootloader onto the microcontroller of an Arduino board. It's not necessary for the standard operation of an Arduino board but can be useful if you're working with a new ATmega microcontroller that doesn't have a bootloader. Ensure that you've chosen the correct board from the "Boards" menu before burning the bootloader on the target board. This command also sets the appropriate fuse settings.

**Help**

- Help and Documentation: In the Arduino IDE, you can conveniently access various documents that come with the software, such as "Getting Started," "Reference," and this guide. These documents are accessible locally without requiring an internet connection. They mirror the online versions and might contain links back to the official website.

- Find in Reference: The "Find in Reference" function within the Help menu is interactive. It directly opens the relevant page in the local Reference documentation for the function or command currently under your cursor.

- Sketchbook: The Arduino IDE employs the concept of a "sketchbook," which serves as a standardized location for storing your programs, often referred to as sketches. You can access sketches from the "File > Sketchbook" menu or the "Open" button on the toolbar. When you first use the Arduino software, it automatically creates a directory for your sketchbook. You can modify the sketchbook's location through the Preferences dialog if needed.

- File Extensions: Starting with version 1.0, sketches are saved with a .ino file extension, while previous versions used the .pde extension. You can still open .pde files in version 1.0 and later, and the software will automatically rename the extension to .ino.

- Tabs, Multiple Files, and Compilation: The Arduino IDE supports the management of sketches with multiple files, each of which appears in its own tab. These files can be standard Arduino code files (with no visible extension), C files (.c extension), C++ files (.cpp), or header files (.h).

**Uploading**

- Preparing for Sketch Upload: Before you upload your sketch to an Arduino board, you must make the correct selections from the "Tools > Board" and "Tools > Port" menus in the Arduino IDE. The specific boards are described below. On a Mac, you will likely find the serial port listed as something like /dev/tty.usbmodem241 (for boards like UNO, Mega2560, or Leonardo) or /dev/tty.usbserial-1B1 (for older USB boards like Duemilanove) or /dev/tty.USA19QW1b1P1.1 (for serial boards connected with a Keyspan USB-to-Serial adapter). On Windows, it might be COM1 or COM2 for serial boards or higher COM numbers like COM4, COM5, COM7 for USB boards. You can check the ports section of the Windows Device Manager for USB serial devices. On Linux, it should be something like /dev/ttyACMx or /dev/ttyUSBx. Once you've chosen the correct serial port and board, you can initiate the sketch upload by clicking the upload button in the toolbar or selecting "Upload" from the "Sketch" menu. With modern Arduino boards, the reset process is automatic, and the upload begins. However, with older boards that lack auto-reset (pre-Diecimila), you need to press the reset button on the board just before starting the upload. Most boards will show the RX and TX LEDs blinking as the sketch is uploaded. The Arduino IDE will provide a message when the upload is complete or display an error if something goes wrong.

- Using the Arduino Bootloader: When you upload a sketch, you are utilizing the Arduino bootloader, a small program already loaded onto the microcontroller of your board. This bootloader allows you to upload code without requiring additional hardware. The bootloader is active for a brief moment when the board resets, after which it loads the most recently uploaded sketch onto the microcontroller. You'll notice the on-board LED (usually connected to pin 13) blinking when the bootloader starts, such as when the board resets

**Libraries**

- Libraries provide extra functionality for use in sketches, e.g. working with hardware or manipulating data. To use a library in a sketch, select it from the Sketch > Import Library menu. This will insert one or more #include statements at the top of the sketch and compile the library with your sketch. Because libraries are uploaded to the board with your sketch, they increase the amount of space they takes up. If a sketch no longer needs a library, simply delete its #include statements from the top of your code.

- There is a list of libraries in the reference. Some libraries are included with the Arduino software. Others can be downloaded from a variety of sources or through the Library Manager. Starting with version 1.0.5 of the IDE, you do can import a library from a zip file and use it in an open sketch. See these instructions for installing a third-party library.

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/second.png">

While on the dashboard, we can scroll through our existing 3D, Codeblocks, or Circuits designs. By picking the editor we want to use and pressing the blue + New icon in the dashboard's top right corner, we can easily create a new design.

The Circuits editor in Tinkercad is organized similarly to its 3D design editor. You'll discover a sizable window for designing our layout on the left. A panel containing parts we can drag and drop onto the workspace to build our circuit is visible on the right side. 
<br>

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/3rd.png">
<br>

Unlike Tinkercad’s 3D design editor, the workspace in Circuits is two-dimensional. We can move our components around by selecting and dragging them, or pan the view around our design by clicking and dragging the empty space around it.

We can also zoom in and out of our design by using the scroll wheel on our mouse, a two-finger gesture on our trackpad, or a key combination of Command + and Command -. 

A “Zoom to fit” button is located in the top left corner of the workspace, which will center and zoom your design to fill the window. Pressing the letter F on your keyboard works as a handy shortcut for this same command.

# Arduino with PIR Sensor Project with LED and Buzzer

<br>
<br>
This project displays how to use an Arduino with a PIR sensor to automatically switch on and off an LED and buzzer.

By monitoring variations in the amounts of infrared (heat) radiation generated by nearby objects, the PIR Sensor detects motion. An LED illuminates the lens dome as a visual cue when motion is detected. The module also outputs a high signal on its output pin.

## **Software**

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## **What is PIR Sensor or PIR Motion Sensor?**

PIR Sensor orPIR Motion Sensor is an electronic sensor that detects changes in infrared light over a certain distance and outputs an electrical signal in response to a detected IR signal. They are small, cheap, low-power, simple to use, and do not wear out. As a result, they are frequently found in appliances and gadgets used in homes and businesses. They are also known as PIR, “Passive Infrared,” “Pyroelectric,” or “IR motion” sensors.

The PIR Sensor is basically composed of a pyroelectric sensor (which can be seen below as a round metal with a rectangular crystal in the centre), that can detect levels of infrared radiation. Everything emits some radiation, and the hotter things emit the greater radiation. In fact, the sensor is split into two halves in a motion detector. The reason is that we try not to detect an average level of IR for motion (change). The two halves are wired to cancel one another. That’s because we’re trying not to detect average IR motion (change) levels. The two halves are wired up to cancel one another. When a half of the radiation is more or less IR, the output swings high or low.

The sensor has a controllable sensitivity that allows motion detection range of 3 meters to 7 metres, as well as includes time delay changes and selection of triggers for fine tuning within your application.

**Key Features:**

- Typically detects a person up to 30 feet away, or up to 15 feet away in low sensitivity mode.
- Field of view is approximately 90 degrees.
- Easy integration in permanent applications is made possible by mounting holes for 2-56 sized screws.
- The dome is illuminated by LEDs as a visual signal of sensor activation.
- Communication with any microcontroller is simple.
- The 3-pin SIP package is ideal for projects that require a breadboard.
- Its small size makes it simple to hide.

**Adjustment**

- Adjusting the distance potentiometer clockwise increases the sensing distance (about 7 meters), while counterclockwise decreases the sensing distance (about 3 meters).
- Adjust the delay potentiometer clockwise to lengthen the delay (300S), or clockwise to shorten the induction delay (5S).

**Typical Applications:**

- Lighting: lamp, automatic switch, street lighting, motion-activated nightlight
- Anti-crime devices: security camera, crime-prevention sensor,  security light, Night security alarm
- Home appliance: air conditioner, air purifier, fan heater
- Audio and Visual devices: TV, PC, display
- Commercial equipments: vending machine, copy machine

<br><br>
PIR Sensor‘s  Out Pin connected to digital pin 2. LED connected from digital pin 4 to ground through a 220ohm resistor. And Buzzer connected to digital PWM(~) pin 5.
<br>
<br>

## **PIR sensor Arduino Code with LED and Buzzer**

    int PIRSensor = 2; //Define PIR Sensor pin
    int Buzzer = 5; //PWM (~) pin
    int LED = 4; //Define LED pin
    int SensorValue = 0; // Initializing the value as zero at the beginning
  
    void setup() {
    pinMode(Buzzer, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(PIRSensor, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
    SensorValue = digitalRead(PIRSensor); // The value read from PIR Sensor pin 2 will be assigned to 'SensorValue'
    if(SensorValue == HIGH){
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
      tone(Buzzer, 5000); //the buzzer sound frequency at 5000 Hz. The frequency range is from 31 Hz to 65535 Hz.
      Serial.println("Motion Detected"); // Print this text in Serial Monitor
    }
    else
    {
      digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
      noTone(Buzzer);
      Serial.println("Motion not Detected");
    }
    }
<br>

**Code Description**

<br>

This Arduino code sets up a simple motion detection system using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor, an LED, and a buzzer. Below is a breakdown of the code:

1. Global Variables

- `PIRSensor`, `Buzzer`, `LED`: These variables store the pin numbers for the PIR sensor, buzzer, and LED respectively.
- `SensorValue`: This variable holds the value read from the PIR sensor.

2. `setup()` Function

- Configures the pinMode for the buzzer, LED, and PIR sensor pins.
- Initializes serial communication with a baud rate of 9600.

3. `loop()` Function (Repeated Execution)

- Reads the digital value from the PIR sensor pin and stores it in `SensorValue`.
- Checks if `SensorValue` is `HIGH` (meaning motion is detected):
  - Turns on the LED by setting its pin to `HIGH`.
  - Activates the buzzer at a frequency of 5000 Hz using the `tone()` function.
  - Prints "Motion Detected" to the Serial Monitor.
- If `SensorValue` is not `HIGH` (motion is not detected):
  - Turns off the LED.
  - Stops the buzzer sound using the `noTone()` function.
  - Prints "Motion not Detected" to the Serial Monitor.

4. Explanation

- The code continuously monitors the PIR sensor. When the sensor detects motion (`SensorValue` becomes `HIGH`), it activates the LED, triggers the buzzer to emit a 5000 Hz sound, and prints "Motion Detected" to the Serial Monitor. When no motion is detected (`SensorValue` is not `HIGH`), it turns off the LED, stops the buzzer sound, and prints "Motion not Detected" to the Serial Monitor.

Ensure the connections for the PIR sensor, LED, and buzzer are appropriately set up and connected to the correct pins as defined in the code (e.g., PIR sensor to pin 2, LED to pin 4, and buzzer to pin 5). Adjustments to pin connections may be needed depending on your physical setup.


## **Result**

<br>
 LED and Buzzer turn ON when an object or motion comes in the range of the PIR Sensor.

**Code Description**
<br>
<br>
This Arduino code is designed to measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor (connected to `trigPin` and `echoPin`), control a servo motor (`servo`), and toggle an LED (`led`). Below is a breakdown of the code:

1. Libraries Used

- `Servo.h`: Library for controlling servo motors.

2. Global Variables

- `trigPin`, `echoPin`, `servoPin`, `led`: These variables store the pin numbers for the ultrasonic sensor's trigger and echo pins, the servo motor, and the LED respectively.
- `duration`, `dist`, `average`: Variables used for storing the duration, distance measured, and the average distance.
- `aver[3]`: Array for storing three distance measurements to calculate an average.

3. `setup()` Function

- Initializes serial communication with a baud rate of 9600.
- Attaches the servo motor to its pin (`servoPin`) and positions it to close the cap (servo.write(0)) on power-up.
- Detaches the servo motor after a brief delay.

4. `measure()` Function

- Triggers the ultrasonic sensor to measure distance:
  - Sends a short LOW-HIGH-LOW pulse to the `trigPin`.
  - Measures the duration of the pulse received on the `echoPin`.
  - Calculates the distance based on the duration of the received pulse.

4. `loop()` Function (Repeated Execution)

- Conducts three measurements using the `measure()` function, storing each distance in the `aver` array.
- Calculates the average distance from the three measurements.
- If the calculated average distance is less than 50 (adjustable threshold), it executes the following:
  - Attaches the servo motor and positions it at 0 degrees (servo.write(0)) for 3 seconds.
  - Moves the servo to 150 degrees for 1 second.
  - Detaches the servo motor.
- Prints the measured distance to the Serial Monitor.

5. Explanation

- The code continuously measures distance using the ultrasonic sensor. If the average distance is below 50 units, it activates the servo motor to move within specified angles (0 and 150 degrees) and toggles the LED. This setup might be used, for instance, to trigger actions (servo movement and LED activation) based on detected proximity (distance less than 50 units).

Ensure the connections for the ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and LED are correctly set up and connected to the designated pins as defined in the code. Adjustments to pin connections may be necessary based on your hardware setup.

# Stepper Motor Control
<br>

## Hardware Required:
<br>

1. Arduino UNO board
2. 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper motor (with driver board)
3. 10k ohm potentiometer
4. Pushbutton
5. 5V power source
6. Bread board
7. Jumper wires

<br>

## Arduino stepper motor control circuit
<br>
<br>
<img style="float: center;" width=1000 height=500 src="PM\AD\stepper\stepper.png">
<br>
<br>
The stepper motor is connected to the ULN2003A board which is supplied with external power source of 5V. The control lines (IN1, IN2, IN3 and IN4) of this board are connected to the Arduino as follows:
INA to Arduino pin 11
INB to Arduino pin 10
INC to Arduino pin 9
IND to Arduino pin 8

The 10k ohm potentiometer is used to control the speed of the stepper motor, its output pin is connected to Arduino analog pin 0.

The push button which is connected to Arduino pin 4 is used to change the rotation direction of the stepper motor.

<img style="float: center;" width=1000 height=400 src="PM\AD\stepper\stepper_diagram.png">


## Arduino unipolar stepper motor control code

    # include <Stepper.h>
The stepper motor which I used in this project is 28BYJ-48, this motor equipped with speed reducer of 1/64. The internal motor has 32 steps per one revolution which means the external shaft has 2048 steps per one revolution (64 x 32). Number of steps is defined in the code as shown below:

    # define STEPS 32
and the connection of the control lines of the stepper motor are defined as:

    Stepper stepper(STEPS, 8, 10, 9, 11);
Using the function stepper.step(direction_) the stepper motor moves according to the variable direction_, in this example this variable may be 1 or -1. If direction_= 1 the motor will move in the first direction and if direction_ = -1 the motor will move in the other direction.

When ever the pushbutton is pressed, the variable direction_ will be inverted (1 or -1).

Rest of code is described through comments.



    # include <Stepper.h>
    # define STEPS 32
    Stepper stepper(STEPS, 8, 10, 9, 11);
    
    const int button =  4; // direction control button is connected to Arduino pin 4
    const int pot    = A0; // speed control potentiometer is connected to analog pin 0
    
    void setup()
    {
      // configure button pin as input with internal pull up enabled
      pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);
    }

    int direction_= 1, speed_ = 0;
    
    void loop()
    {
      if ( digitalRead(button) == 0 )  // if button is pressed
        if ( debounce() )  // debounce button signal
        {
          direction_ *= -1;  // reverse direction variable
          while ( debounce() ) ;  // wait for button release
        }
    
      // read analog value from the potentiometer
      int val = analogRead(pot);
    
      // map digital value from [0, 1023] to [2, 500]
      // ===> min speed = 2 and max speed = 500 rpm
      if ( speed_!= map(val, 0, 1023, 2, 700) )
      { // if the speed was changed
        speed_ = map(val, 0, 1023, 2, 700);
        // set the speed of the motor
        stepper.setSpeed(speed_);
      }
    
      // move the stepper motor
      stepper.step(direction_);
    
    }

    // a small function for button debounce
    bool debounce()
    {
      byte count = 0;
      for(byte i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (digitalRead(button) == 0)
          count++;
        delay(1);
      }
      if(count > 2)  return 1;
      else           return 0;
    }


**Breakdown of the code:**


 **Libraries**

- `#include <Stepper.h>`: Includes the Stepper library that provides functions to control the stepper motor.

 **Pin Definitions**

- `#define STEPS 32`: Defines the number of steps per revolution for the stepper motor.
- `Stepper stepper(STEPS, 8, 10, 9, 11);`: Initializes a stepper motor object named 'stepper' with the number of steps and the pins connected to the motor coils (pins 8, 10, 9, 11).

 **Constants and Variables**

- `const int button = 4;`: Defines a constant 'button' representing the pin to which the direction control button is connected.
- `const int pot = A0;`: Defines a constant 'pot' representing the analog pin to which the speed control potentiometer is connected.
- `int direction_ = 1, speed_ = 0;`: Initializes variables for direction and speed control of the stepper motor.

 **Setup**

- `void setup()`: Setup function runs once at the beginning of the program.
- `pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);`: Configures the button pin as input with an internal pull-up resistor enabled.

 **Loop**

- `void loop()`: Loop function runs repeatedly after the setup.
  - Checks if the button is pressed and debounces the signal to prevent false readings due to noise.
  - Reads the analog value from the potentiometer and maps it to set the speed of the stepper motor in the range of 2 to 500 RPM.
  - Adjusts the speed of the motor using `stepper.setSpeed(speed_)` and moves the motor in the defined direction using `stepper.step(direction_)`.

 **Debouncing Function**

- `bool debounce()`: A function to debounce the button signal to prevent false triggers.
  - It counts how many times the button reads LOW within a short period (debounce time) and returns true if it detects a stable button press.

 **Motor Control**

- The code continuously checks the button for direction changes and the potentiometer for speed changes. If changes are detected, it updates the motor's speed and direction accordingly.

This code creates an Arduino program that allows you to control the direction and speed of a stepper motor using a button and a potentiometer, respectively, ensuring stable and reliable operation through debouncing.

# Stepper Motor Control with an IR Remote

<br>

## Description

Stepper motors are widely used in various applications, such as robotics, CNC machines, and 3D printers, due to their precise control and ability to move in small increments. By combining the stepper motor with an IR remote control, we can create a wireless control system for our projects.

We will be using the ULN2003 driver module to interface the stepper motor with the Arduino. The ULN2003 is a popular driver chip that simplifies the control of stepper motors by providing the necessary current amplification and protection circuitry. It allows us to control the stepper motor using just a few digital pins of the Arduino.For the stepper motor, we use a 28byj-48 stepper motor. It is very affordable, compact and runs on 5-12 Volts, which makes it easy to integrate with Arduino and battery powered projects.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a clear understanding of how to connect the components, write the Arduino code, and control the stepper motor using an IR remote control.

## Required Parts

1. Arduino Uno
2. Dupont Wire Set
3. Breadboard
4. USB Cable for Arduino UNO
5. IR Receiver Module
6. IR Remote Receiver Kit
7. Stepper Motor
8. Arduino IDE

<br>

## Connecting the Parts

In this section we will connect the components to the Arduino.  Since the stepper motor consumes more power than the Arduino can supply, we add a breadboard with an additional power supply. The breadboard will also carry the IR sensor, which needs to be connected to power and an input pin of the Arduino. The picture below shows  the complete wiring.

<img style="float: center;" width=700 height=500 src="PM/AD/ir/ir_circuit.png"> <br>

## Connecting the Stepper Motor and Driver

Let’s start by connecting the stepper motor to the driver board.

The 28byj-48 stepper motor typically comes with a connector that directly fits into the socket on the driver board. Just plugin it in. It will fit only in one orientation.

<img style="float: center;" width=700 height=500 src="PM/AD/ir/md_ir.png"> <br>

Next, we connect the input signals for the motor driver to the output pins of the Arduino board:

<img style="float: center;" width=700 height=500 src="PM/AD/ir/md.png"> <br>

| Arduino   | Driver module  |
| --------  | -------        |
| Pin 12    | INA            |
| Pin 11    | INB            |
| Pin 10    | INC           |
| Pin 9     | IND            |

We finish the wiring of the driver by connecting the power for the driver board to the breadboard. Make sure the red wire connect the positive input of the driver board with the positive power rail on the breadboard (marked by a red line). The black wire connects the negative side to ground (GND).

## Connecting the IR Sensor

Now, let’s place the infrared (IR) sensor on the breadboard and connect it. The negative pin is marked with a (-) sign. We use a black wire to connect this pin to the ground rail of the breadboard. This means the sensor and the driver board using the same ground.


<img style="float: center;" src="PM/AD/ir/ir_s.png"> <br>

The middle pin of the sensor is typically plus. We need to connect this to the 5V output of the Arduino. Below you see the red wire running from the center pin of the IR sensor to the 5V output of the Arduino board.

<img style="float: center;" src="PM/AD/ir/ir_s_a.png"> <br>

## Writing the Arduino Code

In this section we will write the code to control the stepper motor from an IR remote. Specifically, we want to be able to control speed and direction of the stepper motor. In addition, it would be nice if we could stop and start the motor with the press of a button.

The code below does all of that. We will break it into pieces and explain its parts in the following sections.

     #include <IRremote.h>
     #include <AccelStepper.h>

     #define IR_RECEIVE_PIN 8
     #define INA_PIN 12
     #define INB_PIN 11
     #define INC_PIN 10
     #define IND_PIN 9
     #define TYPE AccelStepper::HALF4WIRE
     #define MAXSPEED 1000
     #define MINSPEED 100
     
     int currspeed = 500;
     int prevspeed = 500;
     int inc = 1000;
     int dir = +1;
     
     // Note the pin order 1,3,2,4!
     auto stepper = AccelStepper(TYPE, INA_PIN, INB_PIN, INC_PIN, IND_PIN);
     
     void setup() {
       IrReceiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);
       stepper.setMaxSpeed(MAXSPEED);
     }
     
     void loop() {
       if (IrReceiver.decode()) {
         uint16_t command = IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command;
         if (command == 31) {         // VOL+
           prevspeed = currspeed;
           currspeed = min(currspeed + inc, MAXSPEED);
         } else if (command == 23) {  // VOL-
           prevspeed = currspeed;
           currspeed = max(currspeed - inc, MINSPEED);
         } else if (command == 21) { // MODE
           dir = -dir;
           delay(200);
         } else if (command == 7) {  // PLAY or PAUSE
           currspeed = currspeed > 0 ? 0 : prevspeed;
           delay(200);
         }
         IrReceiver.resume();
       }
       stepper.setSpeed(dir * currspeed);
       stepper.runSpeed();
     }

## Installing the Libraries

First, we need two libraries. IRremote, which is used to read and interpret the signals sent from the IR remote. And AccelStepper, which will make it very easy for us to control the stepper motor. If you don’t have these two libraries already installed, you will need to install them.

     #include <IRremote.h>
     #include <AccelStepper.h> 

## Defining the Constants

Next, we define the constants we will use in the remainder of the code. First, we define the pins for the IR sensor (PIN 8) and the four output pins on the Arduino board that are connected to the input pins of the stepper motor driver (IN1_PIN, …, IN4_PIN)

    #define IR_RECEIVE_PIN 8
    #define IN1_PIN 12
    #define IN2_PIN 11
    #define IN3_PIN 10
    #define IN4_PIN 9

In addition, we need to let the stepper library know, which type of stepper motor we have connected (HALF4WIRE). We also want to specify a maximum and a minimum speed (1000…100). For more details see our tutorial 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver and Arduino.

    #define TYPE AccelStepper::HALF4WIRE
    #define MAXSPEED 1000
    #define MINSPEED 100

## Defining the Variables

Since we want to be able to control the speed of the stepper motor, we need a few variables in addition to the constants above. Specifically, we require the current speed (currspeed), the previous speed of the motor (lastspeed), and the increment (inc) to speed up or slow down the motor. We also have a variable dir, which is either +1 or -1 and determines the direction of rotation.

    int currspeed = 500;
    int prevspeed = 500;
    int inc       = 100;
    int dir       = +1;

Lastly, we create the stepper motor object (stepper), which we need to send commands to the stepper motor.

      auto stepper = AccelStepper(TYPE, IN1_PIN, IN3_PIN, IN2_PIN, IN4_PIN);   

## The Setup Function

The setup function, where we initialize the board, is very simple. We just let the sensor library know, which pins are used for the IR sensor and set the initial speed of the stepper motor to MAXSPEED.

    void setup() {
    receiver.begin(IR_RECEIVE_PIN, ENABLE_LED_FEEDBACK);
    pper.setMaxSpeed(MAXSPEED);
                }

## The Loop Function

All the real action happens in the main loop. Here, we first wait for the IR receiver. If it gets a signal to decode, we decode it and extract the specific command the IR remote sent. Depending on the value of the command variable we either speed up, slow down, change direction or switch between stop and run.

     void loop() {
       if (IrReceiver.decode()) {
     uint16_t command = IrReceiver.decodedIRData.command;
      if (command == 31) {         // VOL+
      prevspeed = currspeed;
      currspeed = min(currspeed + inc, MAXSPEED);
     } else if (command == 23) {  // VOL-
      prevspeed = currspeed;
      currspeed = max(currspeed - inc, MINSPEED);
    } else if (command == 21) { // MODE
      dir = -dir;
      delay(200);
    } else if (command == 7) {  // PLAY or PAUSE
      currspeed = currspeed > 0 ? 0 : prevspeed;
      delay(200);
    }
     IrReceiver.resume();
    }
     stepper.setSpeed(dir * currspeed);    
     stepper.runSpeed();
     }

The command codes are mapped to specific keys (Vol+->31, Vol–>23, Mode->21, Play/Pause->7) on the IR remote. This mapping will depend on the IR remote you are using! To figure out, which keys correspond to which command codes for you remote have a look at our tutorial on How to use an IR receiver and remote with Arduino.

There are some interesting details in the code. Firstly, if we speed up, we need to avoid going faster than MAXSPEED. The min() function ensures that. Similarly, when we slow down, we use the max() function to ensure that we don’t go below MINSPEED.

Change of direction is easy, whenever I press MODE on my remote, the IR receiver reads the command code 21, and we simply change the sign of the dir variable. Note that the dir variable is used later in the code when the speed is set via stepper.setSpeed(dir*currspeed), and determines the direction of rotation (+1 = clockwise, -1 = counter-clockwise).

The last command is to toggle between run or stop using the PLAY/PAUSE key on my remote. We use a ternary condition (c ? a : b) here to check if the current speed if greater than zero. If that is the case, it means the motor is running and we set current speed to zero stop. Alternatively, if the motor is not running (speed is zero), we set the speed to the last known speed (prevspeed).

## Conclusions

We have done how to control a 28byj-48 stepper motor using an IR remote and an ULN2003 driver with the help of an Arduino board. We started by gathering the necessary parts, including the 28byj-48 stepper motor, an IR remote, an ULN2003 driver, and an Arduino board. We then connected these components together, ensuring that the wiring was correct and secure.Next, we wrote the Arduino code to receive IR remote signals and translate them into specific motor movements. By utilizing the IRremote library, we were able to easily capture and interpret the signals sent by the remote control. We then used the ULN2003 driver to control the stepper motor, providing the necessary power and signals to drive the motor in the desired direction and speed.

In conclusion, controlling a 28byj-48 stepper motor with an IR remote using an ULN2003 driver is a fun and practical project that opens up a world of possibilities for automation and robotics.
