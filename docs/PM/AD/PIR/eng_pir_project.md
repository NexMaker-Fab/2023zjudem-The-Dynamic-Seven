# Arduino with PIR Sensor Project with LED and Buzzer
<br>
<br>
This project displays how to use an Arduino with a PIR sensor to automatically switch on and off an LED and buzzer.

By monitoring variations in the amounts of infrared (heat) radiation generated by nearby objects, the PIR Sensor detects motion. An LED illuminates the lens dome as a visual cue when motion is detected. The module also outputs a high signal on its output pin.

## **What is PIR Sensor or PIR Motion Sensor?**

PIR Sensor orPIR Motion Sensor is an electronic sensor that detects changes in infrared light over a certain distance and outputs an electrical signal in response to a detected IR signal. They are small, cheap, low-power, simple to use, and do not wear out. As a result, they are frequently found in appliances and gadgets used in homes and businesses. They are also known as PIR, “Passive Infrared,” “Pyroelectric,” or “IR motion” sensors.

The PIR Sensor is basically composed of a pyroelectric sensor (which can be seen below as a round metal with a rectangular crystal in the centre), that can detect levels of infrared radiation. Everything emits some radiation, and the hotter things emit the greater radiation. In fact, the sensor is split into two halves in a motion detector. The reason is that we try not to detect an average level of IR for motion (change). The two halves are wired to cancel one another. That’s because we’re trying not to detect average IR motion (change) levels. The two halves are wired up to cancel one another. When a half of the radiation is more or less IR, the output swings high or low.

The sensor has a controllable sensitivity that allows motion detection range of 3 meters to 7 metres, as well as includes time delay changes and selection of triggers for fine tuning within your application.


**Key Features:**

* Typically detects a person up to 30 feet away, or up to 15 feet away in low sensitivity mode.
* Field of view is approximately 90 degrees.
* Easy integration in permanent applications is made possible by mounting holes for 2-56 sized screws.
* The dome is illuminated by LEDs as a visual signal of sensor activation.
* Communication with any microcontroller is simple.
* The 3-pin SIP package is ideal for projects that require a breadboard.
* Its small size makes it simple to hide.

**Adjustment**

* Adjusting the distance potentiometer clockwise increases the sensing distance (about 7 meters), while counterclockwise decreases the sensing distance (about 3 meters).
* Adjust the delay potentiometer clockwise to lengthen the delay (300S), or clockwise to shorten the induction delay (5S).

**Typical Applications:**

* Lighting: lamp, automatic switch, street lighting, motion-activated nightlight
* Anti-crime devices: security camera, crime-prevention sensor,  security light, Night security alarm
* Home appliance: air conditioner, air purifier, fan heater
* Audio and Visual devices: TV, PC, display
* Commercial equipments: vending machine, copy machine

<br><br>
PIR Sensor‘s  Out Pin connected to digital pin 2. LED connected from digital pin 4 to ground through a 220ohm resistor. And Buzzer connected to digital PWM(~) pin 5.
<br>

## **PIR sensor Arduino Code with LED and Buzzer**


    int PIRSensor = 2; //Define PIR Sensor pin
    int Buzzer = 5; //PWM (~) pin
    int LED = 4; //Define LED pin
    int SensorValue = 0; // Initializing the value as zero at the beginning
  
    void setup() {
    pinMode(Buzzer, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(PIRSensor, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
    SensorValue = digitalRead(PIRSensor); // The value read from PIR Sensor pin 2 will be assigned to 'SensorValue'
    if(SensorValue == HIGH){
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
      tone(Buzzer, 5000); //the buzzer sound frequency at 5000 Hz. The frequency range is from 31 Hz to 65535 Hz.
      Serial.println("Motion Detected"); // Print this text in Serial Monitor
    }
    else
    {
      digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
      noTone(Buzzer);
      Serial.println("Motion not Detected");
    }
    }


## **Result**
<br>
 LED and Buzzer turn ON when an object or motion comes in the range of the PIR Sensor.
