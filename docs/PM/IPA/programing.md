**Overview**

Processing is a simple programming environment that was created to make it easier to develop visually oriented applications with an emphasis on animation and providing users with instant feedback through interaction. The developers wanted a means to “sketch” ideas in code. As its capabilities have expanded over the past decade, Processing has come to be used for more advanced production-level work in addition to its sketching role. Originally built as a domain-specific extension to Java targeted towards artists and designers, Processing has evolved into a full-blown design and prototyping tool used for large-scale installation work, motion graphics, and complex data visualization.

Processing is based on Java, but because program elements in Processing are fairly simple, you can learn to use it even if you don't know any Java. If you're familiar with Java, it's best to forget that Processing has anything to do with Java for a while, until you get the hang of how the API works.

An important goal for the project was to make this type of programming accessible to a wider audience. For this reason, Processing is free to download, free to use, and open source. But projects developed using the Processing environment and core libraries can be used for any purpose. This model is identical to GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. GCC and its associated libraries (e.g. libc) are open source under the GNU Public License (GPL), which stipulates that changes to the code must be made available. However, programs created with GCC (examples too numerous to mention) are not themselves required to be open source.

Processing consists of:

* The Processing Development Environment (PDE). This is the software that runs when you double-click the Processing icon. The PDE is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with a minimalist set of features designed as a simple introduction to programming or for testing one-off ideas.
* A collection of functions (also referred to as commands or methods) that make up the “core” programming interface, or API, as well as several libraries that support more advanced features such as sending data over a network, reading live images from a webcam, and saving complex imagery in PDF format.
* A language syntax, identical to Java but with a few modifications.
* An active online community, based at <http://processing.org>.
