## Title: InclusiveVision - Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired Individuals


### **Project description**
<br>
<br>

There are multiple smart accessories, such as smart glasses, smart watches, etc., available in the market. But all of them are built for us. There is a significant lack of technology to aid the physically challenged.

We want to build something that is useful for visually challenged people. So we will design a low-cost smart glass that can be used to help the visually impaired.
We strongly believe that technology can be very useful to human beings if put to good use. Just like that, a little piece of tech - "Arduino UNO'" is so much more powerful.

So we thought, why not make a prototype of glasses that can detect the objects in front of them and tell the user by speaking?
These smart glasses can make a huge impact on the lives of blind people. So we thought of making at least a prototype.

### **Working Process:**
<br>
<br>
The smart glasses function through an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the frame. By continuously scanning the environment, the sensor identifies objects in the user's path. When an object approaches within 30 cm, the Arduino UNO, programmed with Python 3, triggers a voice alert through earphones, informing the user to stop and indicating the presence of an obstacle. To speak to the user, "STOP! STOP! THERE IS AN OBJECT VERY NEAR TO YOU." through the earphones.

### **Project Overview**

In a world teeming with smart accessories, InclusiveVision stands out as a beacon of innovation and inclusivity. Recognizing the significant gap in technology catering to the visually impaired, our project aims to create a low-cost, accessible solution to empower individuals with visual challenges.

Objectives:

1. **Enhanced Mobility:** Develop smart glasses equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in the user's path.

2. **Real-time Assistance:** Utilize Arduino UNO and Python programming to enable the glasses to provide immediate auditory alerts when an obstacle is detected within a predefined proximity (e.g., 30 cm).

3. **Affordability and Scalability:** Prioritize the use of cost-effective components, ensuring that the technology is accessible to a wide range of individuals. Aim for scalability to reach more visually impaired communities.

### **Key Features:**

- **User-Centric Design:** Prioritizing user experience, the glasses are designed to be lightweight, comfortable, and discreet, seamlessly integrating into the user's daily life.

- **Customizable Alerts:** Users can personalize the alert messages and tones based on their preferences, enhancing the adaptability of the system.

- **Battery Efficiency:** Implement power-saving features to extend the battery life, ensuring prolonged and reliable usage.

### **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

**SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being:** Improving the safety and well-being of visually impaired individuals.

**SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure:** Utilizing innovative technology for creating accessible and inclusive infrastructure.

**SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities:** Addressing the barriers faced by visually impaired individuals, promoting inclusivity.

**SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals:** Encouraging collaboration among stakeholders for project success and scalability.
