# Title: InclusiveVision - Smart Glasses for Visually Impaired Individuals

# Project Description

There are multiple smart accessories, such as smart glasses, smart watches, etc., available in the market. But all of them are built for us. There is a significant lack of technology to aid the physically challenged.

We want to build something that is useful for visually challenged people. So we will design a low-cost smart glass that can be used to help the visually impaired. We strongly believe that technology can be very useful to human beings if put to good use. Just like that, a little piece of tech - "Arduino UNO'" is so much more powerful.

So we thought, why not make a prototype of glasses that can detect the objects in front of them and tell the user by speaking? These smart glasses can make a huge impact on the lives of blind people. So we thought of making at least a prototype.

# User Research

The primary aim of conducting user research is to understand the needs, preferences, and challenges faced by blind individuals in their daily lives, particularly in the context of object detection. This research will guide the development of an Arduino and ultrasonic-based smart glass for effective object dictation.

**Methodology:**

**Surveys and Questionnaires:**

Develop surveys or questionnaires to collect quantitative data on the daily challenges faced by visually impaired individuals.
Include questions about their experiences with existing assistive technologies and the specific difficulties encountered in object recognition.
Interviews:

Conduct one-on-one interviews with blind individuals to gain qualitative insights into their daily routines and mobility challenges.
Explore their preferences regarding wearable assistive devices and gather feedback on potential features for the smart glass.
Focus Groups:

Organize focus groups with blind or visually impaired individuals to encourage discussion and idea generation.
Explore group dynamics and identify common themes or shared needs related to object detection.
Observational Studies:

Observe individuals in their natural environments to understand specific situations where object detection is crucial.
Note any existing strategies or tools they use for navigating and recognizing objects.
Prototype Testing:

Develop a basic prototype of the smart glass and conduct usability testing sessions with potential users.
Gather feedback on the device's comfort, effectiveness in object detection, and user interface.
Accessibility Experts Consultation:

Consult experts in the field of accessibility, including mobility trainers, rehabilitation specialists, and assistive technology experts.
Seek their insights on the potential challenges and opportunities in developing an effective object dictation smart glass.

**What are some problem happen when blind people walk in road?**

Blind people face numerous challenges when walking in public spaces, especially on roads. Some common problems they may encounter include:

<br>
<img src="FINALPROJECT\PIC\blind.jpg" style="float: center;">
<br>

1. Difficulty in detecting obstacles such as parked cars, construction barriers, street furniture, or other objects that may obstruct the path.
2. Lack of audible or tactile cues to indicate direction changes, intersections, or crossings, making it challenging to navigate safely.
3. Inconsistent or poorly maintained sidewalks, uneven surfaces, and obstacles like potholes or cracked pavement that pose tripping hazards.
4. Lack of accessible information at crosswalks, such as audible signals or tactile indicators, can create challenges in determining the appropriate time to cross.
5. Difficulty in anticipating changes in the environment, like road construction or temporary obstacles, without sufficient awareness tools.

## Inovation 

**Existing Solutions:** 
<br>

Traditionally, visually impaired individuals have relied on various tools and techniques for navigating their surroundings. Some common solutions include: 
<br>

**Long Canes:** <br>

Traditional white canes are extensively used by blind individuals for detecting obstacles and providing a tactile sense of the environment. However, they don't offer real-time feedback or object identification.
<br>

**Guide Dogs:** <br>

Guide dogs are trained to assist blind individuals in navigating obstacles and maintaining a straight path. While highly effective, their availability and extensive training make them less accessible to everyone.
 <br>

**Smartphone Apps:** 
<br>

Various smartphone apps leverage GPS and other technologies to provide navigation assistance. However, these often rely on audio instructions and may not offer detailed real-time information about the immediate surroundings. <br>,

**Braille Maps and Signs:** <br>

Tactile maps and signs with Braille annotations are available in some public spaces, aiding blind individuals in orientation. However, these are static and may not provide dynamic, real-time information. 
<br>

**Innovation in the Project:** <br>

The smart glass project introduces several innovations to address the limitations of existing solutions:

**Real-Time Object Detection**: <br>

Unlike traditional methods, the smart glass incorporates ultrasonic sensors that continuously scan the environment in real-time, providing immediate feedback on obstacles within the user's proximity. <br>
**Voice Alerts using Talkie Library:** <br>

The integration of the Talkie library enhances the user experience by delivering clear and concise voice alerts. This feature ensures that users receive timely information about their surroundings, improving situational awareness. <br>
**Compact and Wearable Design:** <br>

The smart glass is designed to be compact, lightweight, and wearable, offering a hands-free solution for blind individuals. This design innovation enhances user comfort and encourages everyday use. <br>
**Affordability:** <br>

By utilizing Arduino and cost-effective ultrasonic sensors, the project focuses on affordability, making the technology more accessible to a broader range of users. <br>
**Customizable Voice Alerts:** <br>

The use of the Talkie library allows for customizable voice alerts, enabling users to personalize the system according to their preferences and specific needs. <br>
**Integration of Multiple Ultrasonic Sensors:** <br>

The incorporation of three ultrasonic sensors enhances the precision and accuracy of object detection, providing a more comprehensive and reliable navigation experience. <br>
**Open-Source Platform:** <br>

Leveraging Arduino as a central component embraces an open-source platform, encouraging collaboration, further development, and customization within the community of assistive technology enthusiasts.
In summary, the project's innovation lies in its real-time object detection, voice alert system, compact design, affordability, and the integration of multiple ultrasonic sensors, all aimed at significantly enhancing the independence and safety of blind individuals in their daily mobility.
