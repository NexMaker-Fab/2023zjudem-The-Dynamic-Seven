<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/Sketch.jpg">
<BR>

**File**

- New: Creates a new blank editor window with the basic structure of a sketch already set up.

- Open: Allows you to load a sketch file by browsing your computer's drives and folders.

- Open Recent: Provides a short list of the most recently opened sketches for easy access.

- ketchbook: Displays the sketches within the sketchbook folder structure, and clicking on a sketch opens it in a new editor window.

- Examples: Lists all the examples provided by the Arduino Software, organized by topic or library, making them easily accessible.

- Close: Closes the current instance of the Arduino Software (IDE) that you're working in.

- Save: Saves the current sketch with its existing name. If the file hasn't been named previously, you'll be prompted to provide a name in a "Save as..." window. Save as...: Lets you save the current sketch with a different name or in a different location.

- Page Setup: Opens the Page Setup window for configuring print settings.

- Print: Sends the current sketch to the printer based on the settings defined in Page Setup.

- Preferences: Opens the Preferences window where you can customize certain settings of the IDE, including the language of the IDE interface.

- Quit: Closes all open IDE windows. Any sketches that were open when you chose to quit will be automatically reopened the next time you start the IDE.

**Edit**

- Undo/Redo: Allows you to step back or forward through your recent editing actions.

- Cut: Removes the selected text from the editor and stores it in the clipboard for later use.

- Copy: Duplicates the selected text and places it in the clipboard.

- Copy for Forum: Copies your sketch's code to the clipboard in a format suitable for posting in a forum, complete with syntax coloring.

- Copy as HTML: Copies your sketch's code to the clipboard in HTML format, making it suitable for embedding in web pages.

**Sketch**

- Verify/Compile: Checks your sketch for errors by compiling it and provides information on memory usage for code and variables in the console area.

- Upload: Compile your sketch and upload the resulting binary file to the configured Arduino board through the specified port.

- Upload Using Programmer: This option overwrites the bootloader on the board. To restore it and enable USB serial port uploads, you'll need to use "Tools > Burn Bootloader." However, this allows you to utilize the full capacity of the Flash memory for your sketch. Note that this command does not change the fuse settings, which can be adjusted via "Tools > Burn Bootloader."

- Export Compiled Binary: Saves a .hex file, which can be archived or uploaded to the board using other tools.

- Show Sketch Folder: Opens the folder where your current sketch is located.

- Include Library: Allows you to add a library to your sketch by inserting #include statements at the beginning of your code. You can also access the Library Manager from this menu to import new libraries from .zip files.

- Add File...: This option lets you include additional files in your sketch. These files are copied from their current location and stored in the data subfolder of the sketch. This subfolder is intended for assets like documentation and is not compiled as part of the sketch program.

 **Tools**
  
- Auto Format: This feature automatically formats your code, ensuring that curly braces line up correctly and statements within braces are indented properly for improved code readability.

- Archive Sketch: Creates a backup copy of the current sketch in .zip format, storing it in the same directory as the original sketch.

- Fix Encoding & Reload: Resolves potential character encoding discrepancies between the editor and the operating system, ensuring consistent character mapping.

- Serial Monitor: Opens the serial monitor window, allowing data exchange with any connected board on the selected Port. This operation often triggers a reset on the board (if supported) when the serial port is opened.

- Board: Select the specific board you're using from a list. This choice is crucial for configuring the IDE to work with the correct board.

- Port: Lists all the available serial devices (real or virtual) on your computer. The list automatically refreshes each time you open the top-level tools menu.

- Programmer: This option is for selecting a hardware programmer when programming a board or microcontroller that isn't using the onboard USB-serial connection. Typically, this isn't needed for regular use but may be used when burning a bootloader to a new microcontroller.

- Burn Bootloader: This menu allows you to burn a bootloader onto the microcontroller of an Arduino board. It's not necessary for the standard operation of an Arduino board but can be useful if you're working with a new ATmega microcontroller that doesn't have a bootloader. Ensure that you've chosen the correct board from the "Boards" menu before burning the bootloader on the target board. This command also sets the appropriate fuse settings.

**Help**

- Help and Documentation: In the Arduino IDE, you can conveniently access various documents that come with the software, such as "Getting Started," "Reference," and this guide. These documents are accessible locally without requiring an internet connection. They mirror the online versions and might contain links back to the official website.

- Find in Reference: The "Find in Reference" function within the Help menu is interactive. It directly opens the relevant page in the local Reference documentation for the function or command currently under your cursor.

- Sketchbook: The Arduino IDE employs the concept of a "sketchbook," which serves as a standardized location for storing your programs, often referred to as sketches. You can access sketches from the "File > Sketchbook" menu or the "Open" button on the toolbar. When you first use the Arduino software, it automatically creates a directory for your sketchbook. You can modify the sketchbook's location through the Preferences dialog if needed.

- File Extensions: Starting with version 1.0, sketches are saved with a .ino file extension, while previous versions used the .pde extension. You can still open .pde files in version 1.0 and later, and the software will automatically rename the extension to .ino.

- Tabs, Multiple Files, and Compilation: The Arduino IDE supports the management of sketches with multiple files, each of which appears in its own tab. These files can be standard Arduino code files (with no visible extension), C files (.c extension), C++ files (.cpp), or header files (.h).

**Uploading**

- Preparing for Sketch Upload: Before you upload your sketch to an Arduino board, you must make the correct selections from the "Tools > Board" and "Tools > Port" menus in the Arduino IDE. The specific boards are described below. On a Mac, you will likely find the serial port listed as something like /dev/tty.usbmodem241 (for boards like UNO, Mega2560, or Leonardo) or /dev/tty.usbserial-1B1 (for older USB boards like Duemilanove) or /dev/tty.USA19QW1b1P1.1 (for serial boards connected with a Keyspan USB-to-Serial adapter). On Windows, it might be COM1 or COM2 for serial boards or higher COM numbers like COM4, COM5, COM7 for USB boards. You can check the ports section of the Windows Device Manager for USB serial devices. On Linux, it should be something like /dev/ttyACMx or /dev/ttyUSBx. Once you've chosen the correct serial port and board, you can initiate the sketch upload by clicking the upload button in the toolbar or selecting "Upload" from the "Sketch" menu. With modern Arduino boards, the reset process is automatic, and the upload begins. However, with older boards that lack auto-reset (pre-Diecimila), you need to press the reset button on the board just before starting the upload. Most boards will show the RX and TX LEDs blinking as the sketch is uploaded. The Arduino IDE will provide a message when the upload is complete or display an error if something goes wrong.

- Using the Arduino Bootloader: When you upload a sketch, you are utilizing the Arduino bootloader, a small program already loaded onto the microcontroller of your board. This bootloader allows you to upload code without requiring additional hardware. The bootloader is active for a brief moment when the board resets, after which it loads the most recently uploaded sketch onto the microcontroller. You'll notice the on-board LED (usually connected to pin 13) blinking when the bootloader starts, such as when the board resets

**Libraries**

- Libraries provide extra functionality for use in sketches, e.g. working with hardware or manipulating data. To use a library in a sketch, select it from the Sketch > Import Library menu. This will insert one or more #include statements at the top of the sketch and compile the library with your sketch. Because libraries are uploaded to the board with your sketch, they increase the amount of space they takes up. If a sketch no longer needs a library, simply delete its #include statements from the top of your code.

- There is a list of libraries in the reference. Some libraries are included with the Arduino software. Others can be downloaded from a variety of sources or through the Library Manager. Starting with version 1.0.5 of the IDE, you do can import a library from a zip file and use it in an open sketch. See these instructions for installing a third-party library.

1. Exploring Circuits

We may view our most recent designs on a dashboard after logging into Tinkercad. The Circuits part is located under Designs.By clicking Designs on the left, we may locate Circuits. Next, press the Highlight buttons. 

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/second.png">

While on the dashboard, we can scroll through our existing 3D, Codeblocks, or Circuits designs. By picking the editor we want to use and pressing the blue + New icon in the dashboard's top right corner, we can easily create a new design.

The Circuits editor in Tinkercad is organized similarly to its 3D design editor. You'll discover a sizable window for designing our layout on the left. A panel containing parts we can drag and drop onto the workspace to build our circuit is visible on the right side. 
<br>

<img style="float: center;" width=700 src="PM/AD/3rd.png">
<br>

Unlike Tinkercad’s 3D design editor, the workspace in Circuits is two-dimensional. We can move our components around by selecting and dragging them, or pan the view around our design by clicking and dragging the empty space around it.

We can also zoom in and out of our design by using the scroll wheel on our mouse, a two-finger gesture on our trackpad, or a key combination of Command + and Command -. 

A “Zoom to fit” button is located in the top left corner of the workspace, which will center and zoom your design to fill the window. Pressing the letter F on your keyboard works as a handy shortcut for this same command.

             pinMode(7, INPUT);     
          }
          void loop(){
          val=digitalRead(7);
          if(val==HIGH)
          {
             digitalWrite(LED1,HIGH);
             digitalWrite(LED2,LOW);
          }
          else
          { 
             digitalWrite(LED2,HIGH);
             digitalWrite(LED1,LOW);  
          }
          delay(1000);
          }

 **Code Description**
 This code is written in the Arduino programming language and is designed to control two LEDs based on the input from a push button connected to digital pin 7. Below is a description of the code's functionality:

1. **Variable Declarations:**
   - `LED1` and `LED2` are defined as constants with values 12 and 13, respectively. These constants are used to represent the pins to which two LEDs are connected.
   - `val` is declared as an integer to store the value read from digital pin 7.

2. **Setup Function:**
   - In the `setup()` function, the code configures the pins as follows:
     - `LED1` and `LED2` are set as output pins using `pinMode`, which means they will be used to control the LEDs.
     - Pin 7 is set as an input using `pinMode`, indicating that it's connected to a push button or some other digital sensor.

3. **Loop Function:**
   - The `loop()` function is where the main program logic resides, and it runs continuously.

4. **Input Read:**
   - The code reads the state of the push button connected to pin 7 using `digitalRead` and stores the result in the `val` variable.

5. **LED Control:**
   - It then checks the value of `val`. If `val` is `HIGH`, it means the push button is pressed, and the code does the following:
     - Turns on `LED1` by setting it to `HIGH` (illuminating the first LED).
     - Turns off `LED2` by setting it to `LOW`.

   - If `val` is not `HIGH`, it means the push button is not pressed, and the code does the following:
     - Turns on `LED2` by setting it to `HIGH` (illuminating the second LED).
     - Turns off `LED1` by setting it to `LOW`.

6. **Delay:**
   - The code then introduces a 1-second delay using `delay(1000)` before looping again. This delay creates a visual distinction when the button is pressed.

This code sets up two LEDs and a push button, and it toggles the LEDs based on the state of the button. When the button is pressed, one LED is turned on, and the other is turned off. When the button is released, the other LED is turned on, and the first one is turned off. The delay helps control the visual response to the button press.

# Arduino with PIR Sensor Project with LED and Buzzer

<br>
<br>
This project displays how to use an Arduino with a PIR sensor to automatically switch on and off an LED and buzzer.

By monitoring variations in the amounts of infrared (heat) radiation generated by nearby objects, the PIR Sensor detects motion. An LED illuminates the lens dome as a visual cue when motion is detected. The module also outputs a high signal on its output pin.

## **What is PIR Sensor or PIR Motion Sensor?**

PIR Sensor orPIR Motion Sensor is an electronic sensor that detects changes in infrared light over a certain distance and outputs an electrical signal in response to a detected IR signal. They are small, cheap, low-power, simple to use, and do not wear out. As a result, they are frequently found in appliances and gadgets used in homes and businesses. They are also known as PIR, “Passive Infrared,” “Pyroelectric,” or “IR motion” sensors.

The PIR Sensor is basically composed of a pyroelectric sensor (which can be seen below as a round metal with a rectangular crystal in the centre), that can detect levels of infrared radiation. Everything emits some radiation, and the hotter things emit the greater radiation. In fact, the sensor is split into two halves in a motion detector. The reason is that we try not to detect an average level of IR for motion (change). The two halves are wired to cancel one another. That’s because we’re trying not to detect average IR motion (change) levels. The two halves are wired up to cancel one another. When a half of the radiation is more or less IR, the output swings high or low.

The sensor has a controllable sensitivity that allows motion detection range of 3 meters to 7 metres, as well as includes time delay changes and selection of triggers for fine tuning within your application.

**Key Features:**

- Typically detects a person up to 30 feet away, or up to 15 feet away in low sensitivity mode.
- Field of view is approximately 90 degrees.
- Easy integration in permanent applications is made possible by mounting holes for 2-56 sized screws.
- The dome is illuminated by LEDs as a visual signal of sensor activation.
- Communication with any microcontroller is simple.
- The 3-pin SIP package is ideal for projects that require a breadboard.
- Its small size makes it simple to hide.

**Adjustment**

- Adjusting the distance potentiometer clockwise increases the sensing distance (about 7 meters), while counterclockwise decreases the sensing distance (about 3 meters).
- Adjust the delay potentiometer clockwise to lengthen the delay (300S), or clockwise to shorten the induction delay (5S).

**Typical Applications:**

- Lighting: lamp, automatic switch, street lighting, motion-activated nightlight
- Anti-crime devices: security camera, crime-prevention sensor,  security light, Night security alarm
- Home appliance: air conditioner, air purifier, fan heater
- Audio and Visual devices: TV, PC, display
- Commercial equipments: vending machine, copy machine

## **PIR sensor Arduino Code with LED and Buzzer**

    int PIRSensor = 2; //Define PIR Sensor pin
    int Buzzer = 5; //PWM (~) pin
    int LED = 4; //Define LED pin
    int SensorValue = 0; // Initializing the value as zero at the beginning
  
    void setup() {
    pinMode(Buzzer, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(PIRSensor, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
    SensorValue = digitalRead(PIRSensor); // The value read from PIR Sensor pin 2 will be assigned to 'SensorValue'
    if(SensorValue == HIGH){
      digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // Turn LED ON
      tone(Buzzer, 5000); //the buzzer sound frequency at 5000 Hz. The frequency range is from 31 Hz to 65535 Hz.
      Serial.println("Motion Detected"); // Print this text in Serial Monitor
    }
    else
    {
      digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
      noTone(Buzzer);
      Serial.println("Motion not Detected");
    }
    }

## **Result**

<br>
 LED and Buzzer turn ON when an object or motion comes in the range of the PIR Sensor.

# Smart Dustbin

<br>
<br>
Smart Dustbin as its name represents its work smartly or we can say that it is an automatic dustbin.We may conclude that it's a good device for keeping your house tidy and appealing. Children distribute waste primarily through paper, rappers, and a variety of other items from home. They will enjoy themselves greatly with this dustbin as they play with it, and as they play, they also clean your home since the clever dustbin draws children every time they use it. Usually, they will be used to empty all waste and trash into this intelligent dustbin. This can be utilized if you're unable to open it manually because your hands are full of garbage or clutter. Even mosquitoes won't move because it opens automatically without touching, which can help stop the spread of the coronavirus.
